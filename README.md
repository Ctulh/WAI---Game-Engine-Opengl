# WAI---3d-Cube_Viewer
**The project was closed because it might take longer than I have. The goal of this project was to familiarize yourself with OpenGl / Glew / Imgui. Work on other equally interesting projects will begin soon.
*Implemented:
*1*. Abstraction for VertexArray, VertexBuffer, IndexBuffer, TextureArray, Object (the structure containing the previous structures, created for easy navigation among objects), ObjectArray (the structure containing the set of the previous structure)
*2*. Functions of rotation, movement, scaling. Rotation using quaternions.
*3*. file Loader.h returning a structure returned containing a pointer to an array and data on the number of columns and rows in the file being read. Used to add objects from a file and add UV coordinates to the object
*4*. The stencil function allows you to select to identify the object to which the cursor was pointing
*5*. Ability to choose between filling with color and texture mapping
