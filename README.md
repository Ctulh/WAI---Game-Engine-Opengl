# WAI---3d-Cube_Viewer
## The project was closed because it might take longer than I have. The goal of this project was to familiarize yourself with OpenGl / Glew / Imgui. Work on other equally interesting projects will begin soon. 
# Implemented:
* Abstraction for VertexArray, VertexBuffer, IndexBuffer, TextureArray, Object (the structure containing the previous structures, created for easy navigation among objects), ObjectArray (the structure containing the set of the previous structure) 
* Functions of rotation, movement, scaling. Rotation using quaternions. 
* file Loader.h returning a structure returned containing a pointer to an array and data on the number of columns and rows in the file being read. Used to add objects from a file and add UV coordinates to the object 
* The stencil function allows you to select to identify the object to which the cursor was pointing
* Ability to choose between filling with color and texture mapping
